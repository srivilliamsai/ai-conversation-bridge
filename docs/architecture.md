> **Flowise sunset:** [Flowise](https://flowiseai.com/sunset) EOL date **31 August 2026**. This repo defaults to bundled **LangGraph** (`ORCHESTRATOR=langgraph`). `ORCHESTRATOR=flowise` remains in v0.2.0 as a deprecated opt-in if you self-host from the [archived Flowise repository](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise). Do not start new Flowise integrations here.

## Overview
<p align="center">
   <img width="900" alt="AI Conversation Bridge architecture overview" src="assets/architecture.png" />
</p>

The AI Conversation Bridge is a reference architecture for connecting enterprise messaging platforms to Workday through AI-powered orchestration. It addresses four key challenges in the APJ region:

1. **Regulatory restrictions** — Chinese regulations block foreign-hosted LLMs
2. **Language/context gaps** — Enterprise LLMs don't handle customer-specific jargon well
3. **Super-app dominance** — Workers in China use WeChat, Japan uses LINE, Korea uses KakaoTalk
4. **Android unavailability** — Google Play Store is blocked in China

## What This Repo Is / Is Not

### What this repo is

- A reference implementation of the bridge pattern: chat adapters → bundled LangGraph orchestrator → MCP tools → Workday system of action.
- A development and demo environment with a mock MCP server so teams can prototype flows safely.
- A starting point for customers and partners to build production deployments in their own environments.

### What this repo is not

- Not a production-ready Workday MCP endpoint or substitute for Workday Agent Gateway.
- Not a complete multi-platform adapter pack in a single release.
- Not a managed runtime for LLM hosting.

## System Architecture

The diagram above is the canonical view. At a high level:

**Chat platforms** (LINE WORKS, DingTalk, Feishu, …) → **bridge service** (webhook adapters + bundled LangGraph, one process) → **MCP** (demo server or Workday Agent Gateway) → **Workday**.

LangGraph is not a separate deployable box — it runs inside [`bridge-service/`](../bridge-service/) with the channel adapters. Outbound LLM calls go to your configured Chat Completions provider (see the diagram's LLM providers arm).

## Component Details

### Conversation Bridge Service (`bridge-service/`)

A Flask application that:

- Receives webhooks from messaging platforms (channel adapters)
- Invokes the selected orchestrator (`ORCHESTRATOR`: LangGraph by default, or Direct LLM / deprecated Flowise)
- Sends the AI response back to the user

Channel adapters stay thin. LangGraph runs in-process inside this service. Multiple channels can be active in the same deployment.

Because it receives webhooks from external messaging platforms, the bridge service **must be deployed to a public-facing environment** with an HTTPS endpoint. Google Cloud Run is the reference example, but any container platform that provides a public URL works (AWS App Runner, Azure Container Apps, Alibaba Cloud Elastic Container Instance, Tencent Kubernetes Engine, etc.).

**Runtime:** Python / Gunicorn (1 worker, 8 threads) / Cloud Run (or equivalent). LangGraph has been exercised on Cloud Run at 256Mi; leave memory at the platform default unless you hit OOM.

### LangGraph (bundled, default)

When `ORCHESTRATOR=langgraph` (the default), the bridge service compiles a reference ReAct graph at startup, calls the LLM through the **OpenAI Chat Completions** API (`ChatOpenAI` at `LLM_BASE_URL`, typically `POST …/v1/chat/completions`), discovers MCP tools from `MCP_SERVER_URL`, filters them through the built-in **reference allowlist** (or `MCP_TOOL_ALLOWLIST` when configured), and keeps conversation state in an in-memory checkpointer (`STATE_BACKEND=memory`). The reference allowlist includes mock read tools and `request_my_time_off` — it is not a security boundary. The OpenAI Responses API and native Anthropic Messages are not used. Discovery, missing allowlist names, or zero usable tools fail process startup. Pin to a single Cloud Run instance for the reference deploy.

### Direct LLM (`ORCHESTRATOR=direct_llm`)

Optional smoke-test path: the bridge calls the Chat Completions API directly with no MCP tools. Use it to verify webhooks and LLM connectivity before wiring MCP. Does not discover tools or enforce an allowlist.

### Flowise (`flowise/`, deprecated)

When `ORCHESTRATOR=flowise`, the bridge service forwards messages to a customer-hosted Flowise prediction API. Flowise EOL date: 31 August 2026; this path is retained for one release only. Fork the [archived Flowise repository](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise) if you must continue self-hosting.

### MCP Server (`mcp-demo-server/`)

This project includes a demo MCP server with **mock** Workday tools and sample data for development and testing. Deploy it to a cloud environment so the bridge service can reach it at `MCP_SERVER_URL` (include the `/mcp` path).

The demo server has **no authentication** and is not suitable for production use. In production, replace it with **Workday's official MCP endpoints** via Agent Gateway, which provides enterprise-grade security (OAuth 2.1, mTLS, audit logging, network policies). Moving to production is not URL-only — plan for tool discovery, auth, identity mapping, and allowlist updates. Set `MCP_SERVER_URL` on the bridge to the production endpoint.

**Runtime:** Python / FastMCP / Cloud Run (demo) or Workday Agent Gateway (prod)

## Request Flow

```
1. User sends "How many vacation days do I have?" in LINE WORKS, DingTalk, or Feishu
   │
2. Chat platform POSTs webhook to bridge service
   - LINE WORKS: /lineworks/callback (or legacy /callback)
   - DingTalk: /dingtalk/callback
   - Feishu: /feishu/callback
   │
3. bridge service extracts message + platform-scoped session id, claims a
   delivery key so platform retries skip a second orchestrator call, invokes
   the LangGraph orchestrator (default)
   │
4. LangGraph LLM recognizes intent: get_current_user_time_off_balance
   │
5. LangGraph MCP client calls MCP server → get_current_user_time_off_balance()
   │
6. MCP server returns mock data: { vacation: { available: 12, used: 3 } }
   │
7. LangGraph LLM formats response: "You have 12 vacation days remaining (3 used of 15 total)"
   │
8. bridge service receives response, sends it back through the original chat platform
```

## Key Design Principles

### Clean Separation of Concerns

- **Workday** stays the secure "system of action" via MCP
- **Customer** controls the AI layer (their own LLM) and messaging/UI
- **The Bridge** connects chat platforms to the LangGraph orchestrator. With `STATE_BACKEND=memory`, the bridge checkpointer retains conversation history (including tool results that may contain HR data) in process memory for the life of the instance — plan retention and erasure accordingly (see [Enterprise Hardening Guide](enterprise-guide.md)).

### Data Sovereignty

The customer's LLM runs in their own environment when they self-host the bridge and point `LLM_BASE_URL` at a provider in their control. **Default unset `LLM_BASE_URL` / `LLM_MODEL` send traffic to OpenRouter** (`openrouter/free`) — treat that as a demo default, not a residency guarantee. Where the bridge holds conversation state (LangGraph + in-memory checkpointer), that state is subject to the same residency and retention controls as the rest of the customer's deployment.

### Platform Agnostic

The bridge service pattern is repeatable for any messaging platform. Orchestrators do not need platform-specific webhook or reply logic; the bridge passes a platform-scoped session id such as `lineworks:<userId>`, `dingtalk:<conversationId>:<senderStaffId>`, or `feishu:<chat_id>:<sender_id>` so simultaneous chat channels do not collide in conversation memory.

### Production Hardening

This reference architecture implements baseline security (webhook signature verification where configured, input limits, response validation). **Channel security varies:** LINE WORKS rejects callbacks when `LW_API_20_BOT_SECRET` is unset and verifies signatures when it is set; DingTalk in this repo filters by `DINGTALK_ALLOWED_USERS` only (no inbound signature verification); Feishu verifies the event token. For production deployments, see the [Enterprise Hardening Guide](enterprise-guide.md) for additional recommendations on rate limiting, PII handling, retry logic, identity mapping, observability, and infrastructure choices (official Workday MCP servers).
