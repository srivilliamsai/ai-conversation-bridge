This project is a **reference architecture** — most teams will fork and customize it for their own deployments. If you'd like to contribute improvements back upstream (bug fixes, new chat platform adapters, documentation, new demo MCP tools), this guide explains how.

Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating.

## What We Welcome

| Contribution type | Process |
|-------------------|---------|

| New demo MCP tools (with mock data) | Open a PR |
| LangGraph orchestrator improvements | Open a PR |
| Deprecated Flowise flow templates (compatibility only) | Open a PR |
| Translations (see [i18n/GLOSSARY.md](i18n/GLOSSARY.md)) | Open a PR |
| Architectural or framework changes | Open an issue first to discuss |

## License

This project is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the same terms and that you have the right to grant that license.

## Development Setup

All components are designed for **cloud deployment** — chat platform webhooks require public HTTPS endpoints. See the [Setup Guide](docs/setup-guide.md) for full deployment instructions.

For local builds and verification:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh          # create .env files from templates
docker compose build         # verify Dockerfiles
docker compose up --build    # run locally for log inspection / MCP testing
```

> **Tip:** To test the bridge service without MCP tools, set `ORCHESTRATOR=direct_llm` and provide an `LLM_API_KEY` (legacy `AI_PROVIDER=openrouter` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` still work as aliases). This posts to the OpenAI Chat Completions API (`{LLM_BASE_URL}/chat/completions`) with no MCP tools.

## Making Changes

Follow existing patterns in each component. The key conventions:

- **bridge service** (`bridge-service/app/`) — Config in `config.py`, routes in `api/routes.py`, one adapter and client per platform in `channels/<platform>/`. New chat platform adapters should use platform-scoped routes such as `/lineworks/callback` or `/dingtalk/callback`, then call the shared AI pipeline with a platform-scoped session id. Update `.env.example` with any new required variables.

- **LangGraph orchestrator** (`bridge-service/app/orchestration/langgraph/`) — Default path; MCP tool discovery and allowlist live here.

- **Deprecated Flowise flows** (`flowise/flows/`) — Compatibility only; Flowise EOL 31 Aug 2026.

- **MCP server** (`mcp-demo-server/`) — New tools go in `main.py` with type hints and docstrings. Add corresponding mock data as JSON in `mock_data/`.

## Translations

Translations live in `i18n/<lang>/`, mirroring the repo structure — `i18n/zh-Hans/README.md` translates `README.md`, `i18n/ja/docs/architecture.md` translates `docs/architecture.md`, and so on. Currently `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`, `ja`, and `ko`.

Before you start, read **[i18n/GLOSSARY.md](i18n/GLOSSARY.md)**. It records the agreed term for each concept, which product names stay in English, and the style and structural conventions to follow. If you introduce a term that isn't there yet, add a row in the same PR. If you're the first to translate a language, fill in your column.

A few things that are easy to get wrong:

- **Leave the H1 and language-switcher block alone** when replacing a placeholder — the relative link depths are already correct.
- **Relative links need care.** A doc that has a translation stays relative so it resolves inside `i18n/<lang>/`; links to code, assets, or untranslated files need `../../` to escape the language directory.
- **Nothing in CI checks links.** Verify them by hand from the translated file's own directory before opening a PR.
- **ASCII diagrams break silently.** CJK characters are double-width, so translating a label inside a box misaligns the border unless you re-pad it. The glossary has a one-liner to check.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Open an issue first** for non-trivial changes so we can align on approach
2. **Verify containers build** — `docker compose build`
3. **Test your changes** — deploy to a cloud environment for end-to-end verification
4. **Update documentation** if you're changing behavior
5. **Don't commit secrets** — no `.env` files, API keys, or credentials
6. **Write a clear PR description** — the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) will guide you

## Code Style

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting (configured in `pyproject.toml`). Run `ruff check` before submitting. Use type hints and docstrings for public functions. Don't add dependencies without discussion.

## Reporting Issues

- **Bugs:** Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- **Feature requests:** Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
- **Security vulnerabilities:** Do NOT open a public issue — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
